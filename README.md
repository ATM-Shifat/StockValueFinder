# StockValueFinder
This a project Developed in android Studio Platform which will fetch share price of renowned Companies. The Data was fetched from The API  "https://cloud.iexapis.com/". This was my first project in android. S0 there are some bugs in this project. If anyone use this further, I hope you would fix the bugs!
There is a problem in homepage. I used retrofit to fetch data from API. Then i pushed it in a list. But the list become null after the scope of retrofit. I could not fix that.
